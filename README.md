# 💡 **Problem Statement**

Traditional arcade gaming lacks a mechanism for players to bet across various chains on their own performance in a secure and transparent way, limiting the potential for true competitive play and financial engagement. Additionally, current systems lack the ability to verify wins and results in a provable, immutable manner, leading to trust issues in competitive scenarios.

# 🚨 **Forking this repo**

Many people have contacted us asking if they can use this code for their own websites. The answer to that question is usually "yes", with attribution. There are some cases, such as using this code for a business or something that is greater than a personal project, that we may be less comfortable saying yes to.
